# drawMusic

## An app that allows users to draw notes onto a staff

# Phases for building the project:

## Phase 1
Set up the backend with models, controllers, and an empty database.

## Phase 2
Build the database. Fill the seed file with a test assortment of notes and rhythms

## Phase 3 (Bronze Level Project)
Test CRUD functionality (this should mean a MVP will be established)

## Phase 4
Build out the database to include more parameters 

## Phase 5 (Silver Level Project)
Style the project for a user friendly and visually appealing experience

## Phase 6 (Gold Level Project)
Add functionality so that the user has choices for how to interact with the app.

1.) Have dictation exercises where the user will listen to a recording and be required to recreate the sound in a written format.

2.) Have the music written return an audio equivalent of the creation. 
* This is a stretch goal since it would require embedding audio snippets into the json files. *
